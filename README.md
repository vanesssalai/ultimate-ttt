## Rules
The goal is to win 3 of the nine Tic Tac Toe (TTT) Boards arranged in a 3x3 grid.

The game starts with the host, 'X'.

To win a small TTT board, like normal TTT, get 3 of your 'O' or 'X' symbols in a row.

The position you place your symbol in will determine which of the 9 boards your opponent will play in next.

For example, if you place your symbol in the top right cell of a small TTT board, your opponent must place their symbol on the top right board.

If a small board is already won or all the cells are filled, the opponent can choose any available cells in any other board.
